Program which creates zipfiles based on file name commonality. 

Also in this notebook is a POC for using the tkinter package to use a graphical windows interface to choose the file directory of interest. 
This was not fully implemented, but it does look like it would work. 
This feature would eliminate the need to paste in long file path names manually into the script. 

Ideas for future: 
 Would be neat to be able to run the whole program straight from the command line.
